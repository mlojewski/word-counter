This project was a recruitment task. The idea was to prepare word count and statistics for a very long text file. The main goal was to take care of the speed of the process.

Index.php has the form that you need to submit the file url at (does not matter if online or from hard drive).

The core assumption is that all special symbols (commas, dots etc) besides the hyphen, are being removed. So dates are being formatted to digits only. 

The project was created in Symfony 5.
